# An Evaluation of Australia vs. New Zealand

To those people who have not spent time in the Oceanic region of the world, the two countries of Australia and New Zealand often get confused or lumped together due to perceived geographic, cultural, and linguistic similarities.  While this perception may exist, Australia and New Zealand are in fact two very distinct countries.  These types of misperceptions fuel the fire of a playful competitiveness between the two countries, sometimes affectionately referred to as the Trans-Tasman rivalry.

Given the existence of this tounge-in-cheek rivalry, this project will attempt to quantitatively compare the two countries to possibly determine which country  does come out on top as the best.  Ultimately, this project has no true baring on whether one of the two countries is truly superior to other (I do not want to offend any Aussies or Kiwis!); I simply aim to explore and compare the two countries based on the some of the commonly accepted quantitative indicators of quality of life.  Measures that try to capture quality of life, like the Human Development Index, tend to incorporate indicators the topics of economomy, education, and health.  Specifically, the indicators evaluated are gross national income (GNI) per capita, unemployment rate, and life expectancy. This project will identify historical trends while also exploring how these indicators influence each other within the context of the two Oceanic countries.  The data used spans an 8 year frame between 2012 and 2020.  All data and charts in this project were acquired from the [World Development Explorer ](http://www.worlddev.xyz/about).
