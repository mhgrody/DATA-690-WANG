# An Evaluation of Australia vs. New Zealand

To those people who have not spent time in the Oceanic region of the world, the two countries of Australia and New Zealand often get confused or lumped together due to perceived geographic, cultural, and linguistic similarities.  While this perception may exist, Australia and New Zealand are in fact two very distinct countries.  These types of misperceptions fuel the fire of a playful competitiveness between the two countries, sometimes affectionately referred to as the Trans-Tasman rivalry.

Given the existence of this tounge-in-cheek rivalry, this project will attempt to quantitatively compare the two countries to possibly determine which country  does come out on top as the best.  Ultimately, this project has no true baring on whether one of the two countries is truly superior to other (I do not want to offend any Aussies or Kiwis!); I simply aim to explore and compare the two countries based on the some of the commonly accepted quantitative indicators of quality of life.  Measures that try to capture quality of life, like the Human Development Index, tend to incorporate indicators the topics of economomy, education, and health.  Specifically, the indicators evaluated are gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, unemployment rate, and infant mortality rate.  This project will identify historical trends while also exploring how these indicators influence each other within the context of the two Oceanic countries.  In addition, the United States is included in the comparrison in order to contextualize each indicator. The data used spans a 7 year timeframe between 2012 and 2018.  All data and charts in this project were acquired from the [World Development Explorer ](http://www.worlddev.xyz/about).

## The Indicators

### 1. *GDP per Capita*:
> The economic indicator chosen is GDP.  Gross national product (GNI) was alternatively considered, as GNI can be considered a more well rounded economic indicator (unlike GDP, which only indcludes the value of what a country produces, GNI also includes the income earned by residents both domestic and abroad).  However, when comparing the two indicators between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, it is clear there is considerablly more foreign income being earned on a per capita basis comparedd to the two Oceanic countries:

> In order to keep the comparrisons more consistent and on a similar scale, GDP was chosen



### 2. *Unemployment Rate (% of total labor force):*
> The education indicator chosen is unemployment rate.  This indicator was chosen simply because it was one of the few available indicators for education on the World Development Explorer that had data for the two Oceanic countries.



### 3. *Infant Mortality rate (deaths per 1,00):*
> The health indicator chosen is infant mortality rate.  This indicator was chosen because it is considered an incredibly informative metric when evaluating the health of a country.  According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/3138), infant mortality rate "reflects the social, economic and environmental conditions in which children (and others in society) live, including their health care."
